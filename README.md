# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
Use a scraping-friendly website to add images of Mars' hemispheres.  To do this, I have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
